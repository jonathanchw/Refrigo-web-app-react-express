## Refrigo_Web_App_React_Express

This repository contains the code of my final project for the Professional Web Master course at UTN, Buenos Aires


### About the app

Actually, there are two separated apps. The Client which serves the FrontEnd (using React), and the Server (in Node/Express).
For this Web App a database table in mysql language is needed which is in the root folder (refrigodb.sql).
For its use you could use a MySQL database manager like Xammp, and then you should configure the file (...server\config.json) to get the database address.


### How to run the Server

  1. In your terminal, navigate to the server directory. `...\refrigo_react_express>cd server`
  2. Run npm install to install all dependencies. `...\refrigo_react_express\server>npm install`
    (be sure to have Xammp running and have the server config.json file configured.) 
  3. Run npm start to start the app. `...\refrigo_react_express\server>npm start`
  4. If everything works you can view the database in JSON format at this address http://localhost:9000/db.


### How to run the Client

  1. In another terminal, navigate to the client directory. `...\refrigo_react_express>cd client`
  2. Run npm install to install all dependencies. `...\refrigo_react_express\client>npm install`
  3. Run npm start to start the app. `...\refrigo_react_express\client>npm start`
  4. If everything works, it should automatically open a tab in your default browser with the address http://localhost:3000/.
